You got my heart really rocking
You leave my knees weak and knocking
You put a swivel in my hips
You put a kissing in my lips

Oh, don't ever, ever
Ever leave my sight
You excite me

You got a twinkle in your eyes
And a way to tantalize
That makes me want to hold you tight
And want to make some love tonight

You send me into outer space
You're just the living end
And every time that we embrace
I know you're more than
Just a friend

You give my body such a chill
You really give a guy a thrill
And when you dance
You start a shake up
That little sissy has to wake up

You send me into outer space
You're just the living end
And every time that we embrace
I know you're more than
Just a friend

You give my body such a chill
You really give a guy a thrill
And when you dance
You start a shake up
That little sissy has to wake up

Oh, don't ever, ever
Ever leave my sight
Cause you excite me
