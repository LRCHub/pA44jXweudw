Two hours sitting in a hotel room together
You've been talking about your problems but I don't care
You cried about how you wish you had someone like me
But when everybody else is around you don't care
You don't make me feel anything for anyone
But I guess I'm bored and lonely too
So close your eyes and excite me
They'll be back in an hour or two
They don't have to know the things that we're gonna do
So close your eyes and excite me
They'll be back in an hour or two
They don't have to know the things that we're gonna do, ooh ooh
